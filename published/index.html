        <a href="CR-78"><h3>Roland CompuRythm CR-78</h3></a>
        <p></p>
<p>The Roland CompuRythm CR-78 was released in 1978. It&#39;s a beautiful piece of design with a sound to match. They don&#39;t make them like this anymore.The CR-78 became a favourite amongst pop and electronic artists for it&#39;s unique sound. Famous songs which use it include Orchestral Manoeuvres in The Dark&#39;s &quot;Enola Gay&quot; and Blondie&#39;s &quot;Heart of Glass&quot;. The CR-78 was also one of the first drum machines to offer user programmable sequences alongside the standard Waltz, Shuffle and Samba presets.</p>
<p>We decided to sample the CR-78 though a Universal Audio 1176 compressor to give it a little more analog magic.</p>
