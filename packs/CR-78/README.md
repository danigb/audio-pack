The Roland CompuRythm CR-78 was released in 1978. It's a beautiful piece of design with a sound to match. They don't make them like this anymore.The CR-78 became a favourite amongst pop and electronic artists for it's unique sound. Famous songs which use it include Orchestral Manoeuvres in The Dark's "Enola Gay" and Blondie's "Heart of Glass". The CR-78 was also one of the first drum machines to offer user programmable sequences alongside the standard Waltz, Shuffle and Samba presets.

We decided to sample the CR-78 though a Universal Audio 1176 compressor to give it a little more analog magic.
